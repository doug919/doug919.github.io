![AboutMe](images/about.jpg){:height="350px" .callout}
I am a fifth-year Ph.D student at Department of Computer Science at Purdue University, working under [Dr. Dan Goldwassser](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgoldwas/). I specialize in solving Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems with Machine Learning techniques. I hope to share my expertise through innovative works with engineers and information scientists all over the global.

My PhD thesis is about modeling script knowledge, or human common sense, to refine Natural Language Understanding (NLU). The technique, Statistical Script Learning, aims at building statistical models that capture the common sense about "what happens next." In other words, given some events happened in the past, can machines make reasonable inferences about events that might happen in the future? Imagine that your Siri can guess what you want without explicitly stating it. My ultimate goal is to connect script knowledge with such real-world applications so that better machine-human communicatinos can happen.
