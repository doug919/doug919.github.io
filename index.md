![AboutMe](images/about.jpg){:height="350px" .callout}
I am a fifth-year Ph.D student at Department of Computer Science of Purdue University, working under [Dr. Dan Goldwassser](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgoldwas/). I specialize in dealing with Natural Language Understanding (NLU) problems with Machine Learning techniques. I hope to share my expertise through innovative works with engineers and information scientists all over the global.

My research interest is mainly about modeling human commonsense to refine NLU. The technique, Statistical Script Learning, aims at building statistical models that capture the commonsense of "what happens next." In other words, given some events happened in the past, can machines make reasonable inferences about what would happen in the future? Imagine that your Siri can guess what you want without explicitly asking her. My ultimate goal is to connect machine commonsense with real-world applications so that better machine-human communicatinos can happen.
