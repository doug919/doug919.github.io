![AboutMe](images/about.jpg){:height="350px" .callout}
I am a fifth-year Ph.D student at Department of Computer Science of Purdue University, working under [Dr. Dan Goldwassser](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgoldwas/). I specialize in handling problems that require Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Machine Learning techniques. I hope to share my expertise through innovative works with engineers and information scientists all over the global.

My research interest resides in modeling human commonsense to refine NLU. The technique, Statistical Script Learning, aims at building statistical models that can infer "what happens next." In other words, it predicts the next event given some events happened in the past. Imagine that your Siri can guess what you want without explicitly commanding. My ultimate goal is to connect machine commonsense with real-world applications so that better machine-human communicatinos can happen.
