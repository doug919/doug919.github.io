![AboutMe](images/about.jpg){:height="350px" .callout}
A Research Scientist at Meta working on user purchasing intent and representation modeling for Ads Personalization. I earned my PhD at Department of Computer Science of Purdue University on 2020, advised by [Dr. Dan Goldwasser](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgoldwas/). I specialize in tackling the problems that require Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Machine Learning techniques. I hope to share my expertise through innovative works with engineers and information scientists all over the global.

My research interest resides in modeling human commonsense to refine NLU. My PhD thesis focuses on constructing commonsense models with Statistical Script Learning, whose core concept is predicting “what happens next.” Specifically, the models predict the next event given what have happened in the past. Imagine that your Siri can guess what you want without explicitly commanding. My ultimate goal is to build machine commonsense in real-world applications such that better machine-human communications can happen.
